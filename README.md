The true title is :

"THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE"

This is the final project created by Paul Li and Waley Liu

The final project is a platformer game, where you are a nyan cat. 
You are working for your stripes, but your fellow nyans who dont have stripes stop you. 
You must kill and destroy all the other nyan cats in the game, or you 
will subcome to the darkness like tac nayn. 

FIGHT. 
EAT.
KILL.

FIGHT TO THE DEATH. 
EAT YOUR SUBSTANYANCE. 
KILL YOUR FELLOW NYANS. 
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. 

Coding Process:
We had fun for the most part, at each step of the way. 
We worked on things seperately, but told each other what we wanted to do 
before we started, and agreed on what to do.
Paul took the lead and guided me (Waley) for what
to be done. It was a hard process, but it was rewarding. 

Problems:
GITHUB:
annoying. 
merging was weird.
git hub was thought to be something extremely annoying. 
however, halfway through the project, it was pretty nice. 
Helped to tell the other person what to do/ 
what was done. 

Communication:
We had decent communication throughtout. 
We would talk about what was done, and how to 
improve the game. 

Ideas:
the decsion for nyan cat started late, 
but blossomed into something nice (i guess).
